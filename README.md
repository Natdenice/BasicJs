# BasicJs

In this mini exercise, we have to write three basics JS functions.
The first function has been made in order to display the highest value included in a array ( in my case, it is myMax function )
The second function enables us to count the number of vowels included in a string ( function vowelsCount)
Finally, the last function enables us to reverse a string ( function reverse )

You will find a lot of explanation comments in my JS Script ( in french for the moment ) , in order to make the code active,
you have just to uncomment all explanation text and it will work fine !

Enjoy !
